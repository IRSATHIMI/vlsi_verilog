BELOW 8 to 13 questions implement only structural method
8. and gate using 2x1 mux
9. xor gate using 2x1 mux
10. xnor gate using 2x1 mux
11. nand gate using 2x1 mux
12. nor gate using 2x1 mux
13. or gate using 2x1 mux

o display internal signals of design in tb
o xnor gate using 2x1 mux
o not gate using 2x1 mux


14. implement 2 bit comparator using 1 bit comparator use structural method?

	expression:-
	E-> (A1 xnor B1) (A0 xnor B0)
	L-> A1'B1 + (A1 xnor B1)A0'B0
	G-> A1B1' + (A1 xnor B1)A0B0'

15. 4 bit full adder using 1 bit full adder?

NOTE:-
	1. if at all you have used space between filename
		i.e mux_4x1 structural.v
		then during including of the file
		use backslash "\"
	2. keep into point that verilog/sv language will not allow us to use space for writing module name
		i.e having 
			module mux_4x1 structural(pot_list); --> is not allowed 
		if at all we have to use space in giving module name use underscore "_"
		i.e do 
			module mux_4x1_structural(poty_list); --> is allowed 

	3. during design instantiation, we have to use the entire design module name.
	4. during compilation command i.e vlog if at all file name has space inbetween them 
		use vlog tb_mux_4x1\ structural.v

o How to write $display and $monitor statements?

syntax:-
	$monitor(arguments);
