1Q. reg [10:3] vect_a;
   reg [7:1] vect_b=69;

   vect_a = vect_b;
69 = 'b1000101

   vect_a[3] = vect_b[1];  1
   vect_a[4] = vect_b[2];  0
   vect_a[5] = vect_b[3];  1
   vect_a[6] = vect_b[4];  0
   vect_a[7] = vect_b[5];  0
   vect_a[8] = vect_b[6];  0
   vect_a[9] = vect_b[7];  1
   vect_a[10] =  0;

   what is vecta[7]; -> 0
   what is vecta[7:4]; -> 0010
   what is vecta[5:1]; -> wrong reson there is no position 2 and position 1 in vect a
   what is vecta[5:3]; ->101

2Q. integer a;
	assign a=10;
	
	can we implement above code if not why?
	what should be the changes made to above code?

Ans:-
	No
	reason?
		assign is a continuously statatemnt 
		integer reg type
		reg is discretely driven
		we cant use assign on interger based variable

	to execute above code 

	use procedural blocks

		initial begin
			a=10;
		end
				
				or

	integer a_t;
	wire [31:0] a;

	assign a=a_t;

		initial begin
			a_t=10;
		end

	

3Q. wire [5:0] b;
	assign b=13;

	can we execute above logic?
Ans:-
	yes
	since b is continuously drivven variable we can use continuously assign statements

4Q declare input "a" as vector whose MSb is 4 and vector size is 8
Ans:- 
formula:-
	size = magnitude[MSB-LSB] +1
	size = 8 
	MSB = 4

	intput [4:-3]a;

agenda:-
  o time
  o realtime
  o timescale
  o clock generation

o time:-
 is a datatype what is used to measure the current simulation time.
 these are reg based variable
 store the current simulation time in integer format

 How to declare ?
 	time variable_name;
	size is 32 bits


o realtime:-
 is a datatype what is used to measure the current simulation time.
 store the current simulation time in real format

 How to declare ?
 	realtime variable_name;

	size is 64 bits

Q.in the code where to use time and realtime variables?
-> use them inside procedural blocks


Q. how to get the simulation time in integer format and real format?
-> verilog systemtask
		$time
			what is $time
				used to return the current simulation time in integer format
		$realtime
				used to return the current simulation time in real format

o timescale:-

	synyax:-
		
		`timescale timestep/timeprecission

		timestep 
			used to measute the delay
			used to measure how frequently simulation will run in the simulation events
				
				simulation events in verilog 
					Active region
						blocking assignments
						RHS value gets evaluated[out = a+b]
						assign
						$display
					inactive region
						0 delay statements
					non-blocking region
						LHS
					monitor region

			example:-
				dialy schedule									codes
					9am to 9:45am -> travell					
					10am to 1pm   -> verilog session
					3pm to 5pm    -> sv session
					6pm to 7pm    -> travell

				this scehedule i follow for one month  			entire simulation

				now ;
					how much frequently am i doing this dialy task in JULY     -> timestep
						july -> how many days -> 31 -> -4 -> 27 times 
							each day for 27 days in july month -> timestep
			
			used to measure delay?
				in code
					initial begin
						#10; -> these are called as delay statement 
							 -> delay_number * timestep
							 if timestep declared is 1ps
							 -> 10*1ps = 10ps
							 if timestep declared is 1ns
							 -> 10*1ns = 10ns
							 if timestep declared is 10ns
							 -> 10*10ns = 100ns
						#200;

					end

	
		timeprecission
			how delay values are rounded off before being used in simulation
				lowest possible measurable value

				dealy values > timeprecission

		example:-
			`timescale 10ns/10ps

		1	#0.5    ->  0.5 * 10ns -> 5ns > 10ps -> yes [measurable unit]
		2	#0.05    ->  0.05 * 10ns -> 0.5ns-> 500ps > 10ps -> yes [measurable unit]
									0.5 * 10 ** -9
									500*10**-12
		3	#0.005    ->  0.005 * 10ns -> 0.05ns-> 50ps > 10ps -> yes [measurable unit]
		4	#0.0005    ->  0.0005 * 10ns -> 0.005ns-> 5ps > 10ps -> NO [NOT a measurable unit]

		in scenario 4 
		since we are having timeprecission of 10ps we cant measure 0.0005 value 
		so the simulator will treat this value as 0



Question:-
1. what is the default value of timestep?
2. what is the default value of timeprecission?

=> depends on tool which we use and also the version of tool
	MODELSIM  -> `timescale 1ps/1ps
	QUESTASIm -> `timescale 1ns/1ns


guideline:-
1. number to be used
	1,10 or 100
2. char(unit) that can be used 
	s
	ms
	microsec
	ns
	ps
	fs

Question:-

1. when we will use timescale concept
		to generate of clk having timeperiod and duty cycle.

2. even thoughe we dont mention explicitely the timescale values
	tool will be having default timescale declared 


NOTE:-
	run.do

	here run is a userdefined filename
	an user can also save the .do files as sim.do or execute.do

	MODELSImM or QUESTASIm

	if user create the file as run.do
	in tool he has to give 
		do run.do
		here 1st "do" word -> its a command in modelsim telling the tool to execute the tcl script file
		run.do is the file that has the commands 

	if user create the file as sim.do
	in tool he has to give 
		do sim.do
		here 1st "do" word -> its a command in modelsim telling the tool to execute the tcl script file
		sim.do is the file that has the commands
