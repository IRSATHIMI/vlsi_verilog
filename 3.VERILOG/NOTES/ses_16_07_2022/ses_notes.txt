Q. how to declare strings?
	we use reg bases datatypes
		reg [8*n:1]

Q. what is net ?
	nets are continuously driven ports

Q what are the types of net
	4 types
	wand, wor, tri, wire

Q. wand used?
Q. wor used?
Q. tri used?
Q. wire used?

____________________________________________________________________________________
o reg 
	inside procedural blocks variables on the LHS of the assignment we declare them as reg .

	ex:-
		inital begin
			a=20;
			b=a;
			c=34;
		end
		we have to declare a,b,c as reg type

	- reg types are scalar quantity.
	what is scalar?
		single bit

	- by default size of reg is 1 hence they are scalar quantity.

	- variables declare as registers we can use them inside procedural blocks only[i.e always block or initial block]
	- we cant use reg based variables using assign keyword.
		example:-
			module top;
			reg [3:0] addr;
			assign addr=10; -> this statement is wrong . Q why?
			/** Error: reg_ex.v(3): Register is illegal in left-hand side of continuous assignment/
			endmodule
	Q. why?
		assign statements are used on continuously driven ports i.e net based datatypes
		in out current example 
		we are using addr variables which is declared as reg which is discretly driven port 

	how to solve this issue?

			module top;
			reg [3:0] addr;
			wire [3:0] addr_tmp;
			assign addr_tmp=addr;//this is correct 
			initial begin
					addr=10;
			end
			endmodule

o vectors
	multi vit variable

	Q. how to declare a vector?
		datatype [MSB:LSB] variable_name;

	Q. size of a vector?
		magnitude[MSB-LSB]+1

	example:-
		reg [-3:6] var_a;
		what is the size of var_a?
			size = 10

			magnitude[-9] +1
			9+1
			10

		reg [5:22] var_b;// MSB - 5 LSB - 22
		what is the size of var_b?
		size = 18


	Q. what all datatypes can i use for declaration of vectors?
		reg or net[wand wor tri wire]

	Q. why?
		because they are one bit datatype 

	Q. integer [3:0] a; is this correct?

	
	o use of wr_rd signal whcich is input to memory?
		
		wr_rd signal is used to indicate wheather memeory should perform write operatopn or read operation
			wr_rd = 1 -> we do write operation to memory
			wr_rd = 0 -> we do read operation from memory

	o direction for the ports required to design cam be declared in port list itself
	i.e
	example:-
		half adder

		inputs a,b,
		output sum,carry

	module declaration :-
		module ha(a,b,sum,carry);
			input a,b;
			output sum,carry;
		endmodule

	different approach for module declaration:-
		module ha(input a, input b,output sum, output carry);

		endmodule


	NOTE:-
		its a good programming practice to declare signals that are inputs to the design as _i
		its a good programming practice to declare signals that are outputs from the design as _o

			module ha(input a_i, input b_i,output sum_o, output carry_o);

		endmodule
