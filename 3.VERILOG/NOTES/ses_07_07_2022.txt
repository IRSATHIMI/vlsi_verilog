Plan:
	- Verilog:   (Modelsim)
		Language: 3-4 weeks
		Project: 3 weeks
	- SV language (Questasim)
		7 weeks
	- UVM
		4 weeks
		AHB project
	- Projects
		AXI project
		Ethernet MAC 

Verilog:
	o 1 week of training combinatiional logic
	o 2 -3 weeks on sequential logic

Notes:
1. I want to develop a mobile phone chip
	- manually come up with 100 crore transistors => start connecting them manyally => this is ruled out.

2. what is high level description?
   what is low level description?

3. Mod-6 counter
	we want to fabricate a chip which behaves like mod-6 counter

4. what is low level description?
	o come up with design in terms of gates.


gates <--- boolean expression <---- k-maps <---- Truth table <--- design behavor

C2  C1  C0     N2  N1  N0	D2   D1   D0
-----------------------------------------
0   0   0      0   0   1    0    0     1
0   0   1      0   1   0    0    1     0
0   1   0      0   1   1    0    1     1
0   1   1      1   0   0    1    0     0
1   0   0      1   0   1    1    0     1
1   0   1      0   0   0    0    0     0

Kmaps: D2, D1, D0
D2 = C2~C0 | C1C0
D1 = C1~C0 | ~C2~C1C0
D0 = ~C0

5. Any design can be implemented in two ways
	o high level description => more like writing Engligh
	o low level description => 
		- truth tbale -> k-maps -> boolean expression => FFs, gates

6. 100% of time(always), we will prefet high level description only.

7. why then, low level description is required?
	high level description --->  low level description -> chip get manufactured
		o EDA tools are important.
		o Synthesis tools(Design compiler, Genus)

8. Verilog has 4 styles of coding
	o behavioral style
		o preferred for sequential logic
		o always
	o data flow style
		o preferred for combinational logic
		o assign
	o structural style
		o using logic gates
		o other smaller modules to implement bigger modules
	o switch level
		o using nmos, pmos switches

9. examples
	o mux
	o half adder
	o full adder
	o subtractor
	o decoder
	o encoder
	o comparator
	o demux
	o priority encoder
	o multiplier

10. mux
	o 2x1 mux, 4x1 mux, 8x1 mux
	o 3x1 mux

11Q.
inside and gate you write (o/p, i/p) but generally we write (i/p,o/p) is there any format  for that

12Q.  why are writing 2’bxx instead we can write 2bxx (why are u using tick)

120KM
KM120 => not a dsitance convention

13.
{i0, i1, i2, i3, sel} = $random; //$rnaodm generates a 32 bit random value
		= 32'b1010_1110_1010_0000_1100_1111_1010_1110;

next iteration
{i0, i1, i2, i3, sel} = $random; //$rnaodm generates a 32 bit random value
		= 32'b1110_1110_1010_0000_1100_1111_1111_0011;

sel = $random; //$rnaodm generates a 32 bit random value
		= 32'b1110_1110_1010_0000_1100_1111_1111_0011;
