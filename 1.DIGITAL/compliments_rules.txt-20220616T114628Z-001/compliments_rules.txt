RULES to check 1's compliment:-

	Case 1:- Both are positive number
	-> no need to do complement
	-> add both of them keep carry as it is.

	Case 2:- if we have used compliment for either of subtrahend or minuend
	-> if there is no carry in the result
		 -> check for MSB bit of the result after addition
		           - if it is ‘1’, number is –ve, then do 1’s compliment, keep –ve sign
		           - if it is ‘0’, number is +ve , then don’t take compliment, result is +ve
	-> if there is a carry in the result
		-> add carry to final result 	

	Case 3:- If we have used complement for both the minuend and subtrahend 
	-> Result is always negative signed.
		-> add carry
		-> then do 1s complement





 2's compliment rule
RULES:-
Case 1:- Both are positive number
	-> no need to do complement
	-> add both of them keep carry as it is.

Case 2:- if we have used compliment for either of subtrahend or minuend
	-> if there is no carry in the result
		 -> check for MSB bit of the result
		           - if it is ‘1’, number is –ve, then do 2’s compliment, keep –ve sign
		           - if it is ‘0’, number is +ve , then don’t take compliment, result is +ve
	-> if there is a carry in the result
		->ignore carry to final result 	

Case 3:- If we have used complement for both the minuend and subtrahend 
	-> Result is always negative signed.
		->ignore carry
		-> then do 2s complement


o RULES FOR 9's COMPLIMENT

case 1:- Both are positive 
		no need of compliment
		just add them
		keep carry as it is

case 2:- if we have used complement in any of the number
		-> if there is no carry in result, then my number is -ve
			-> we have to take 9's compliment of the res and keep the -ve sign

		-> if carry is there
				add carry to the result and rsult will be +ve sign.


case 3:- if we have done compliment for both numbers

			-> result is -ve
			->if carry is there add carry to the number 
					take the 9's compliment of the number keep the -ve sign


		
10's compliment:-
	9's compliment +1

RULE:-

case 1:- Both are positive 
		no need of compliment
		just add them
		keep carry as it is

case 2:- if we have used complement in any of the number
		-> if there is no carry in result, then my number is -ve
			-> we have to take 10's compliment of the res and keep the -ve sign

		-> if carry is there
				ignore the carry and rsult will be +ve sign.

case 3:- if we have done compliment for both numbers

			-> result is -ve
			->if carry is there
					ignore it
					take the 10's compliment of the number keep the -ve sign

		-> if not carry generated after adding
