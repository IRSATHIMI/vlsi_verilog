Software description languages such as Verilog are similar to 
software programming languages because they include ways of describing 
the propagation time and signal strengths. There are two 
types of assignment operators; a blocking assignment, and 
a non-blocking assignment. The non-blocking 
assignment allows designers to describe a state-machine update
