Questions:
1. Clock generation
  o in SOC: clock is not generated using forever(only TB purpose)
  o SOC: Crystal, VCO, PLL
  o Clock -> various clocks derived from a common clock
  o clock frequency multiplication, dvision can be done(digital design concpets)
  o to double the clock frequency : delay the output clock by a buffer(adding delay of 1/4 clock period)
	o feed it as input to XOR gate and another input is clock itself

  o various clocks => clock controler logic => registers wehre we program them to choose among these clocks, drive it on output clock
		o clock selection
  o when freq =100MHz => 50Mhz (clock division)
  o some times we don;t need clock => clock gating

2. generate clock with 75% duty cycle
  o 75% time it is high, 25% low
  o run the simualtion, check the waveform

3. generate a clock with 3-5% of jitter
  o if there is any way to generate clock with specific jitter value?
  o how do we ensure circuit does not get effect by jitter?

4. clock distribution
  o many components in a subsystme may be working on same clock
  o we have to follow T-branch apporach

5. Dual port memory write, read design & testbench
- one port is for writing
- one port is for reading
- 2 ports, snce we want to do paralle operation
   o what if both are accesisng same locaiton=> RACE condition
- benefit : increased throguput

6. How do we verify very large memories?
- we can;t verify by writing and reading each locaiton
- we are not verifying memory locaitons, we are actually verifying port connecitons
- Actually we are verifuing port connectivity, that is where below techniques will be used
  - backdoor load memory, read some locaiton through fornt door, check teh data with data loaded
